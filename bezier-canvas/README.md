# Bézier on canvas

This is a project with a interactive Bézier, curve. it is simple, you cam play with it and se the ball following the curve and enable and disable information from being shown on the right panel

# Running

As it use module, it isn't possible to run it without serving it. I am looking ahead to host it somewhere, but for now, i recommend opening it with vscode live-server
